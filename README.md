# Ilumini

Ilumini is a platform designed as a final project for the <img src="https://docs.code-fu.net.ni/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CS50x.ni-01.svg" alt="Ilumini Logo" width="80"/> course, aiming to boost business growth by helping businesses achieve greater visibility. It includes a dedicated section where businesses can post about their company, products, or services. Users can interact through comments, reactions, and share posts, making it easier to spread the word and engage with the brand.

Additionally, we offer a reservation section, ideal for businesses focused on event planning. Here, users can explore services, view different packages and prices, and make reservations easily.

Ilumini also includes a review and rating system, where customers can evaluate the services they have received, leaving comments and scores that help build trust with future clients and allow businesses to continuously improve.

To facilitate communication, there is a direct messaging feature, allowing users to easily contact businesses to ask questions or make requests before confirming a reservation, creating a personalized and efficient customer experience.

With these tools, Ilumini aims to be an all-in-one solution for businesses to grow, connect with their audience, and optimize the management of reservations and services.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
