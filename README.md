# Ilumini

Ilumini is a platform designed as a final project for the <img src="https://docs.code-fu.net.ni/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CS50x.ni-01.svg" alt="Ilumini Logo" width="80"/> course, aiming to boost business growth by helping businesses achieve greater visibility. It includes a dedicated section where businesses can post about their company, products, or services. Users can interact through comments, reactions, and share posts, making it easier to spread the word and engage with the brand.

Additionally, we offer a reservation section, ideal for businesses focused on event planning. Here, users can explore services, view different packages and prices, and make reservations easily.

Ilumini also includes a review and rating system, where customers can evaluate the services they have received, leaving comments and scores that help build trust with future clients and allow businesses to continuously improve.

To facilitate communication, there is a direct messaging feature, allowing users to easily contact businesses to ask questions or make requests before confirming a reservation, creating a personalized and efficient customer experience.

With these tools, Ilumini aims to be an all-in-one solution for businesses to grow, connect with their audience, and optimize the management of reservations and services.
